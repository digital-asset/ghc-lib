# [Why we git clone on linux here]
# At this time, `git clone https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc.git`
# from within `CI.hs` does not work on on linux. This appears to be a
# known Travis/ubuntu SSL verification issue. We've tried many less
# drastic workarounds. This grand hack is the only way we've found so
# far that can be made to work.
